# 06 - WeatherDashboard


## Week 06 Challenge - Accepted

### Introduction: 

This repository was created to build a weather dashboard with server side API's. The user will want to know the weather of their chosen city and type it into the search box in order to update the current weather plus a 5 day outlook. 

### Highlights:

The Daily Planner was built with the Open Weather Map API to display current weather and a five day forecast with icons showing each days weather. The date and time is posted in the header to let the user know the current time and date. The Bulma Css framework is utilized to give the buttons and card sections a pop of color. 

The main weather display exhibits a blue background to draw the users eyes to the main section for the current days weather information. The information shown consists of the Temperature, Humidity, Wind, and UV Index. 

A notable feature is the date in the header was accentuated to clearly standout for the user using Google Fonts. I chose the Merriweather style font: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=weather&preview.text=Daily%20forecast:%20&preview.text_type=custom). 

The Image here represents an example of the city of San Francisco and the data for weather shown.
